All of this API Package required for Black and White SPA Project to get and post data acquired from Filled Form on Frontpage. APIs will processing that data and store it on Database. this API using RESTful API concept and Codeigniter based. 

This API is also Helps The React Service Worker so this website can store cache and operated in offline mode and some feature can be accessed offline without any internet connection. But the client still need the internet Connection to access primary feature such as Queue system, News and Promos and Login Register.
